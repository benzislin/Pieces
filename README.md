# Pieces
This is a game I created as a submission to the 5th Official Brackeys Game Jam, using the C# programming language in Unity over 7 days.
A game jam is a competition in which individuals or teams develop a playable game from scratch within a short, fixed period, typically a few days, around a central theme or constraint. The theme for this particular game jam was "Stronger Together".
Pieces is a lofi puzzle game in which the player's actions are seperated into four different characters, and they must strategically determine the order in which to combine and use their actions simultaneously.
To play the game, please download and unzip the file "playPieces.zip".
